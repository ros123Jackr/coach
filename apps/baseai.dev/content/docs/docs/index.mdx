    BaseAI is the first web AI framework for building Serverless AI agents with Node.js and TypeScript.

    - **OPEN**: BaseAI is **free and open-source**
    - **LOCAL**: world-class **local developer experience**
    - **CLEAN**: unlike existing frameworks, BaseAI has zero bloatware **no boilerplate code**
    - **COMPOSABLE**: build composable AI **pipes** (agents), **tools** (self-healing), and **memory** (RAG)
    - **SERVERLESS**: prod-ready, easily [**deploy to Serverless AI cloud**][lb] with `npx baseai deploy` command

</span>

Developers use BaseAI to develop high-quality AI agents with memory (RAG) using TypeScript and then deploy serverless as a highly scalable API using [⌘ Langbase][lb] (creators of BaseAI).

    secondary={{ href: 'https://github.com/LangbaseInc/baseai', text: '★ Star BaseAI on GitHub' }}
/>

1. Start by building local AI agents we call [Pipes](/docs/pipe/quickstart)
2. Then create a local semantic [memory (RAG)](/docs/memory/quickstart) so your AI agents can chat with your data

## Why we created BaseAI

<SpoilerAdvanced title="Built for Web Developers" sub="90% AI use-cases are on the web — BaseAI is API, TypeScript, and web first">
BaseAI is web-first with TypeScript support and a familiar RESTful API. Integrate AI into your web stack as easily as adding a React component or API route—whether you're using Next.js, Vue, or vanilla Node.js. With most AI use cases on the web, BaseAI helps you ship AI features faster.
</SpoilerAdvanced>

<SpoilerAdvanced title="Local developer experience" sub="Zero-cost local development, version-control, and complete observability logs">
Develop AI features on your machine with zero cloud costs. Git integrates out of the box, so you can branch and merge AI models like code. Complete observability logs let you debug AI like JavaScript—trace decisions, data points, and outputs. It's like Chrome DevTools for your AI.
</SpoilerAdvanced>

<SpoilerAdvanced title="Deploy to Serverless AI Cloud" sub="Seriously easy to deploy: One command serverless deployment on ⌘ Langbase">
Deploy your AI with a single command:

```shell
npx baseai@latest deploy
```

BaseAI handles deployment to ⌘ Langbase, a serverless composable AI developers platform. No complex kubernetes, docker container, or hybrid cloud configs. Your AI scales effortlessly from zero to billions of requests. Most companies switch to Langbase for its simplicity, cost effectiveness, going from 5-7 different vendors to one.

<SpoilerAdvanced title="Self-Healing Agentic Tool-Calling" sub="Auto tool calls and result handling with self-healing agents to 21% extra reduced hallucinations">
BaseAI reduces AI hallucinations by 21% with self-healing agentic tool-calling and agentic memory (for deep reasoning like OpenAI's o1 but with 100+ LLMs). Your AI not only uses tools but also detects and corrects its own errors—re-querying or seeking additional data when needed. This makes your AI more reliable and trustworthy.
</SpoilerAdvanced>

<SpoilerAdvanced title="Full-Stack Memory x RAG Vector Store" sub="Vector db's aren't enough, full-spectrum parsing, chunking, attributes, retrieval testing, and similarity search">
BaseAI offers a full-stack memory system beyond traditional vector stores. It provides full-spectrum parsing for context understanding, intelligent chunking for optimal retrieval, and attribution for transparency. With retrieval testing and advanced similarity search, your AI finds not just similar info but the right info.
</SpoilerAdvanced>

<SpoilerAdvanced title="Composable AI: Agentic ( Pipes | Tools | Memory )" sub="Like React components or Docker containers, AI pipes are composable agents of AI automation workflows">
BaseAI introduces composable AI with agentic pipes, tools, and memory. Think of AI components like React components or Docker containers for AI logic. Snap together a sentiment analysis pipe with a support ticket response generator. Add memory to your chatbot as a module. Context switch between ten different memories and 200+ agentic tool calls in one single auto-healing workflow. These agentic components can make decisions and adapt, enabling scalable, reusable AI workflows.
